# PrintScan
This tool is in beta, use at your own risk.

Tool will first test for anonymous FTP.

Tool will then test for default SNMP.

Tool will then attempt to extract users from known HP printers job user log. Please consider sending me a copy of the HTML of any printers you identify with the same vulnerability and I will code a new method into this function.
